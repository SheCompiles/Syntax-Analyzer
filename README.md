# sheCompiles - Project 2 (Syntax Analyzer)
For this compiler project, we are implementing a syntax analyzer for the programming language Toy, as defined in Project 1 - Lexical Analyzer. A CFG G was defined based on a Backus Normal Form (BNF) description. From this, we wrote a program to create a parsing table for G, and performed a one-symbol lookahead parsing on various input Toy programs, as well as printed appropriate parsing actions.

## Steps to Run & Compile Project 2's Syntax Analyzer
***Helpful Tip: the same steps apply with each toy test case - examples are provided below!***

```
Steps to Run with P1Test.toy:
1. make -f make.mk
2. ./a.out < P1Test.toy > P1TestOutput.txt
 ```
 ```
 Steps to Run with TestCase1.toy:
 1. make -f make.mk
 2. ./a.out < TestCase1.toy > TestCase1Output.txt 
 ```
 ```
 Steps to Run with WorkingTestCase1.toy:
 1. make -f make.mk
 2. ./a.out < WorkingTestCase1.toy > WorkingTestCase1Output.txt 
 ```
 ```
 Steps to Run with FailingTestCase1.toy:
 1. make -f make.mk
 2. ./a.out < FailingTestCase1.toy > FailingTestCase1Output.txt 
 ```
